P2PChating App

This project was built in the Android OS platform that uses Android SDK Wifip2pManager for Wi-Fi Direct for making a peer-to-peer connection. This project also used java socket programming to make TCP connection for exchanging information like text. The motivation for choosing this project was to implement Peer-to-Peer architecture along with socket programming that was taught in this course. This project is also able to make mesh networks by connecting several android devices by using the Wifip2pManager public class that is included in android API level 14. After connecting devices via Wi-Fi peer-to-peer connectivity, this project used the typical idea of java socket programming for sending and receiving data. Though the socket can exchange any kind of data, this project is limited to exchange only text data for messaging purposes. The future task for this project is to implement a user-friendly messaging UI design and make this app able to exchange any kind of data.
